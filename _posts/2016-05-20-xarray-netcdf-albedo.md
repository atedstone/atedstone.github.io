title: Introduction to xarray and NetCDF files
---

I gave a simple introduction to other Python users in Bristol Geography on how to use Python's [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org) package to manipulate and plot multi-dimensional datasets.

See the page on the [Bristol Geography Python repo](https://github.com/Chris35Wills/Bristol_Geography_Python/tree/master/xarray) for some example code and plots.
