## BLACK and BLOOM

This NERC-funded project aims to unravel the variations in the albedo of the Greenland Ice Sheet as a result of interactions between microbes and particulates. The darker the ice sheet surface is the more it melts, so microbes and particulates could increase the rate at which sea level rise occurs. 

I am using two main approaches to examine whether microbes and particulates could be important controls on melting:

* **Satellite observations** to characterize the reflectivity (albedo) of the ice sheet surface. In particular I am looking for signs of algal growth and black carbon and to see whether there are any local and regional patterns in their location.
* **Regional climate modelling** to project the potential impact of algal growth and black carbon upon melting of the ice sheet in the future, by including their impact upon albedo in the model scheme.

The project brings together a range of experts in micro-biology, atmospheric chemistry, mass balance and remote sensing. There are several large field campaigns planned (of which I am a part) in order to make measurements of algae, black carbon and melting on the ice sheet surface. 

The whole project consists of four work packages delivered across five institutions along with several other partners. A website will be available soon.
