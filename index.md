**I am a glaciologist working on the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet.** I use a combination of field measurements, remotely-sensed data and computer models to explore the vulnerability of the Greenland Ice Sheet to projected climate change. I have particular interests in the manipulation and analysis of large, multi-dimensional datasets.

Currently I am based in the [Department of Geosciences](https://www3.unifr.ch/geo/en/) at Université de Fribourg, Switzerland. 

I developed [**GeoRaster**](blog/georaster-released), a Python package for working with geographic rasters. Since November 2020 I have been part of a team which builds on GeoRaster to deliver improved tools which take advantage of recent major improvements in Python's data science ecosystem: [GlacioHack](https://github.com/GlacioHack).
