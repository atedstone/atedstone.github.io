**I am a glaciologist working on the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet.** I use a combination of field measurements, remotely-sensed data and computer models to explore the vulnerability of the Greenland Ice Sheet to projected climate change. I have particular interests in the manipulation and analysis of large, multi-dimensional datasets.

Currently I am based in the [Bristol Glaciology Centre](http://www.bris.ac.uk/geography/research/bgc/) at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bris.ac.uk/), where I am employed on *BLACK and BLOOM*, a NERC-funded project which aims to unravel the variations in the albedo of the Greenland Ice Sheet as a result of interactions between microbes and particulates.
