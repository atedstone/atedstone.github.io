**I am a glaciologist working on the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet.** I use a combination of field measurements, remotely-sensed data and computer models to explore the vulnerability of the Greenland Ice Sheet to projected climate change. I have particular interests in the manipulation and analysis of large, multi-dimensional datasets.

I am a Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [Starting Grant 2023 awardee](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/218095). In August 2024, I will start as an Assistant Professor at the University of Lausanne.

I originally developed [**GeoRaster**](blog/georaster-released), a Python package for working with geographic rasters. Now, this functionality is wrapped up and extended in GeoUtils, delivered by the [GlacioHack](https://github.com/GlacioHack) team.
