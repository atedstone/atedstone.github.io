**I am a glaciologist working on the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet.** I use a combination of field measurements, remotely-sensed data and computer models to explore the vulnerability of the Greenland Ice Sheet to projected climate change. I have particular interests in the manipulation and analysis of large, multi-dimensional datasets.

Currently I am based in the [Department of Geosciences](https://www3.unifr.ch/geo/en/) at Université de Fribourg, Switzerland. I am also an Honorary Researcher at the [Bristol Glaciology Centre](http://www.bris.ac.uk/geography/research/bgc/) at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bris.ac.uk/).

I have developed **GeoRaster**, a Python package for working with geographic rasters. Take a look at the [blog post](blog/georaster-released), [documentation](http://georaster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [GitHub repository](https://github.com/atedstone/georaster) for more details. However, as of November 2020, I am developing improvedr tools which take advantage of recent major improvements in Python's data science ecosystem, in collaboration with colleagues: [GlacioHack](https://github.com/GlacioHack).
